<h2>Configuration</h2>

In order to configure *Jeta* you need to create `jeta.properties` file in the root package of the source set. It's a plain *Java Properties* file with `key=value` format.
Unfortunately, there's no way of knowning where the source directory is located, so you must provide it by yourself. There are two ways to achieve this. First one is to declare `sourcepath` option in your `build.gradle`:

### `build.gradle`

```groovy
compileJava {
    options.sourcepath = files('src/main/java')
}
```

The second way is available using `apt` arguments. Note that you need a plugin that supports this feature. If not, there are some hacks that might help, so you should google it. If your plugin allows, add next snippet into the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
apt {
    arguments {
        jetaProperties "$project.projectDir/src/main/java/jeta.properties"
    }
}
```

### `jeta.properties`
Let's go through the options available to controll code generating. As previously mentioned, the most required property is `metasitory.package`. It must be unique for any module, e.g. test module. You will need this package to provide to `MapMetasitory` constructor at runtime to use this metasitory. The other options are described below as comments:

```
# Source directory path. Absolute or relative to `jeta.properties` path
# to the source folder. Define it in case `jeta.properties` isn't in the root
# of the source set. (`.` by default)
sourcepath=.

# Unique per module java package, where metasitory will be stored.
# (`` by default, recommended to define)
metasitory.package=com.example

# Set this option to `true` to skip code re-generating in case the master's source code
# hasn't been changed since the previous run. Boost up code processing.
# (`false` by default)
utd.enable=true

# Delete metacode if its master does not exists anymore
# (`true` by default if `utd` feature's enabled)
utd.cleanup=true

# Absolute or relative to `jeta.properties` path, where `utd` data is stored
# ('java.io.tmpdir' by default, recommended to define)
utd.dir=../../../build/jeta-utd-files

# Output debug information (false by default)
debug=true

# Output the time metacode built in (true by default)
debug.built_time=true

# Output `utd` statuses:
#  `+` - metacode created or rewritten
#  `-` - metacode removed (if `utd.cleanup` enabled)
#  `*` - master is up-to-date
# (`true` by default if `debug` and `utd` are enabled)
debug.utd_states=true

# Custome annotation processors (comma separated)
# go to http://jeta.brooth.org/guide/custom-processor
processors.add=com.example.apt.MyCustomProcessor

# Disable a processor by its annotation (comma separated, reg-exp allowed)
processors.disable=^Meta.*$,^Log$

# Metacode file header
file.comment=\n Use is subject to license terms. \n

# Default scope for dependency injection
# go to http://jeta.brooth.org/guide/inject
inject.scope.default = org.brooth.jeta.tests.inject.DefaultScope

# org.brooth.jeta.inject.Inject annotation alias.
inject.alias=javax.inject.Inject

# org.brooth.jeta.Provider alias
inject.alias.provider=javax.inject.Provider

# Custom metasitory writer
# go to http://jeta.brooth.org/guide/custom-metasitory
metasitory.writer=org.brooth.jeta.apt.EchoMetasitoryWriter
