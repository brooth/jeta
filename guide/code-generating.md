### `javax.annotation.processing`

It's good to know: *Jeta* isn't evaluating the annotations by using *Reflection API* at runtime. It generates all the necessary code at compile-time. It allows to emit metacode as it's handwritten. Also, unlike reflection, it's possible to check the code for errors before it's launched.


### How it works:
There's a bit of information on the Internet, but `javac` allows us to generate source code. Moreover, it's available since Java <span class="label label-info">1.5</span>. It can launch an [Annotation Processor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html) before your Java sources will be compiled, so you can scan and process all the annotations in your code.

    Currenty jeta is tested on Java 1.7. Older version might be supported in future releases.

<span class="label label-success">Thanks to</span> [JavaPoet by Square](https://github.com/square/javapoet) for the great framework that *Jeta* uses to write Java code.

### Hello, World!<a name="HelloWorldSample"></a>
Let's take a look at the example, in which `@SayHello` annotation sets *"Hello, World!"* into the field.

```java
public @interface SayHello {
}

public class HelloWorldSample {
    @SayHello
    String str;
}
```

If *Jeta* had a processor for this example, the metacode would be:

```java
public class HelloWorldSample_Metacode implements HelloWorldMetacode<HelloWorldSample> {
    @Override
    public void setHelloWorld(HelloWorldSample master) {
        master.str = "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

You can find sample code of such processor on [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/guide/custom-processor.html). Also, there's a similar example on [GitHub](https://github.com/brooth/jeta-samples).

How `HelloWorldSample_Metacode` is applied to `HelloWorldSample` is explained in the [next article]({{ site.baseurl }}/guide/at-runtime.html).
