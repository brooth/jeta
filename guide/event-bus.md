*Jeta* providers an implementation of [*Publish-Subscribe* pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish-subscribe_pattern). Besides basic features, it has a great advantage - no reflection is used at all. Excited? Let's go through.

### Subscriber

```java
class Subscriber {
    private SubscriptionHandler handler;

    public Subscriber() {
        handler = MetaHelper.registerSubscriber(this);
    }

    @Subscribe
    protected void onMessage(Message msg) {
    }
}
```

As well as [observer's handler]({{ site.baseurl }}/guide/observer.html), `SubscriptionHandler` lets you control subscription workflow. You can stop listening to a message:

```java
handler.unregister(Message.class);
```

or all of them:

```java
handler.unregisterAll();
```

### Priority

You're able to order the handlers by priority. Handlers with higher priority will be invoked first:

```java
@Subscribe(priority = 146)
protected void onMessage(Message msg) {
}
```

### Filters

*Jeta Event-Bus* supports filters, so you can reject unwanted messages:

```java
@Subscribe(filters = { OddFilter.class })
protected void onMessage(Message msg) {
}
```

For the illustration, `OddFilter` code is:

```java
public class OddFilter implements Filter<Object, MyMessage> {
    public boolean accepts(Object master, String methodName, MyMessage msg) {
        return msg.id() % 2 != 0;
    }
}
```

Two filters are available out of the box, by `id` and by `topic`. You can define them via `@Subscribe` annotation:

```java
@Subscribe(id = {2, 4}, topic = {"two", "four"})
protected void onMessage(Message msg) {
}
```

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> To make `id` and `topic` filters possible, all messages must implement `org.brooth.jeta.eventbus.Message` interface or extend `org.brooth.jeta.eventbus.BaseMessage` class.


### MetaFilters

As previously mentioned, *Jeta* is designed to detect as many errors at compile-time as possible . With plain filters this principle works via generic types. Let's say we have a filter that works with a particular message type:

```java
public class MyMessage extends BaseMessage {
}

public class MyFilter implements Filter<Object, MyMessage> {
    public boolean accepts(Object master, String methodName, Message msg) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

If you try to use this filter on a method with a parameter which not assigneble from `MyMessage` class, the code won't be compiled, but *MetaFilters* allow you to write more complex checks, e.g. access to a nonprivate constant:

```java
@MetaFilter(emitExpression = "$m.THE_NUMBER % 2 == 0")
public interface EvenMetaFilter extends Filter {}
```

Here `$m` will be replaced with the master class in which this filter is used. So if the master doesn't have field `THE_NUMBER`, you will get the error during compilation. You can also use `$e` to get access to the message instance.


### MetaHelper

You can either use *Jeta* basic implementation of `EventBus` - `org.brooth.jeta.eventbus.BaseEventBus` or implement your own. Also, you can use a single instance of the bus or create many. Nevertheless, you must pass an instance of the bus to the controller. Let's create a helper method for:

```java
public static SubscriptionHandler registerSubscriber(Object master) {
    return new SubscriberController<>(metasitory, master).registerSubscriber(bus);
}
```

You definitely should follow [this link]({{ site.baseurl }}/guide/meta-helper.html) if you are still not familiar with *MetaHelper*.
