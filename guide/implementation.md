In a multi-module project you may have a case when a feature can to be implemented in many ways, e.g. *DbManger* needs a driver to work with a database. It might be `sqlite`, `postgres` or any other. *DbManger* does a lot - supports JPQL, mappings, DAO and other cool features. However, it depends on the driver that allows it to communicate with the exact DB implementation. Let's see how *Jeta Implementation* can help:

```java
class DbManger {
    DbDriver driver;

    public DbManger() {
        driver = MetaHelper.getImplementation(DbDriver.class);
        if(driver == null)
            throw new IllegalStateException("Db driver not defined");
    }
}

interface DbDriver {
    // methods to work with a db...
}
```

In a module, where we want to use `DbManger`, we can provide an implementation:

```java
@Implementation(DbDriver.class)
class SqliteDbDriver implements DbDriver {
    //...
}
```

Furthermore, in the test module we can substitute the driver with a fake one:

```java
@Implementation(DbDriver.class, priority = 10)
class TestDbDriver implements DbDriver {
    //...
}
```

### MetaHelper

The helper method would be:

```java
public static <I> getImplementation(Class<I> of) {
    return new ImplementationController<I>(metasitory, of).getImplementation();
}
```

In addition to `getImplementation()`, *ImplementationController* provides `getImplementations()` method, if it's necessary to get all implementations, and `hasImplementation()` to check if there is any.
